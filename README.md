# Restaurant-tips-analysis
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. A part of Swiss Coding Academy course.

Data source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv

**Description of dataset:** The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987. 

It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

### The main goal of the project is to identify relationship between variables and the tip givens to generate valuable insight beneficial to the restaurant

## Result: 

After performing descriptive statistics, this analysis focuses on several key comparisons in tipping behavior, including differences between smokers and non-smokers, male and female customers, weekends versus weekdays, and lunch versus dinner time.

### Smokers vs Non-smokers:

Insight: Smokers tend to tip slightly more than non-smokers in terms of both average and median tip values. However, the difference is relatively small and the distributions largely overlap, suggesting no strong practical difference in tipping behavior between the two groups.

### Male vs Female:

Insight: Based on the generated histogram as well as max, mean and median tip value. It can be concluded that Male tip more Female in general especially the max value where Male's tip value is almost 40% higher compared to Female's

### Weekends vs Weekdays:

Insight: Customers tend to leave higher tips on weekends compared to weekdays. Both the average and median tip values are higher during weekends, indicating a noticeable difference in tipping behavior.

### Lunch vs Dinner:

Insight: Dinner customers consistently leave higher tips than lunch customers. This is supported by higher average and median tip values, as well as a wider distribution of tip amounts during dinner time.

## Conclusion: 
Overall, the analysis shows that time-related factors such as weekends and dinner service have a stronger relationship with higher tip values than customer characteristics such as smoking status or gender. These insights may help restaurants better allocate staff and optimize service during peak tipping periods.
